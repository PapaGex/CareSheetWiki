Take it slow and step by step!
Ask all the questions! 
Do not stay stuck for more than 1 hour. 
The Express and Models setup should take around 2-5 hours.
For most of the "getting started" tasks, don't guess! Look it up or ask, then implement.

Set up npm, install Express

Configure Express to use Handlebars (just like your Cube app, or Google "configure express handlebars"
Setup your routing: 
https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html

Test all guest routes res.send("Login route works...")
*This should take around 1-3 hours to complete. If you've spent that much time make sure you're asking questions.
Once your basic routes are working, move on to the Models

Create the Schema and Models. https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html
Then test by writing a hard coded entry that creates a new object based on the model and saves it to your database. 
Check your Mongo DB to verify the data is being saved.

Just like the kitten example on the Mongoose docs.
*This should take around 1-2 hours to complete.
Now work on controllers ( req, res, next) => { // your code here }
Now using your working models and routes, start to add the functionality.
Start with all the guest user routes
Render the home page with data from your database
Set up registering a user, take it slow and step by step
Console log to make sure you're getting the data at each step
Break each controllers task down into smaller pieces and solve one at a time
For example login, you have to first find the user, then check the password, then create a JWT and then redirect them.
